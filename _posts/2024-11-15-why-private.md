Everybody's getting into AI. The visceral experience of using ChatGPT in professional or personal lives raises lots of questions. Questions about the future of work, creativity, civilization's lifespan...

One big question that comes up is about **control**. How can an organization or individual maintain a certain amount of control over their expereince when using AI?

Not everyone cares about this. But for those who do, it's critical.

I think there are three major reasons why organizations want control over their AI-powered applications, and I'll discuss them in this post: **Data**, **Model Performance**, and **Cost**.


## Data

### Privacy and security guarantees

### Compliance with regulations

### IP and copyright protection 



## Model Performance

### Improve speed and reduce latency with control over hardware

### Fine-tune models easily to improve quality

### Integrate private datasets without taking on risk


## Cost

### No surprise bills for data egress or bursting during busy times

### No per-token or per-user licensing that grows over time

### Emphasis on best-of-breed open source tools prevents lockin


## Conclusion: The World Will Be Hybrid

It seems to me that Private AI is just like Private Cloud. Public experiences will win hearts, minds, and popular culture. Meanwhile, many "legacy" companies are going to try and get the same experience in private. The result will be a mix of both, due to the three major considerations of data privacy, model performance, and costs.
